      <h1>Global Electritcity Consumption</h1>
      <p>
        Electricity Consumption is an amount of electricity being consumed by the population,
        countries and all the world. It has been an important energy that the human uses it since
        after bulbs were created by <b>Thomas Edison</b>. The electricity consumption can be generated from many
        different sources such as coal, diesel, gas, water and other energy sources. There are two sources to 
        generate the electricity. One is Non-renewable energy sources and another one is renewable energy 
        sources.

      It visualizes the total electricity consumption around the world. 
      In this visualization, there is color hue used for the color choice. 
      When the country consumes less electricity, then the color will be in light green. 
      Likewise, the higher the electricity consumption, the darker the color it has such as from 
      yellow to dark red.
      In this idiom, there is high electricity consumption in 
      <span style="color: #900C3F; font-size: large;"><b>United States, Canada and Australia</b></span>. 
      Let's explore why these country have higher electricity consumption than other countries.

        <h2>Renewable Energy Production around the world</h2>
        <p>
          Renewable Energy is important in Earth as it is energy derived from natural resources. It produces electricity with 
          less damage impact on environment compared to non-renewable energy. It can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. This
          map idiom visualises the renewable energy production around the world. Hence, it is important to explore
          the renewable energy sources around the world. Renewable Energy included solar electricity, hydro electricity, 
          wind electricity and other renewable electricity. In this visualisation, 
          countries like <span style="color: #1e5631; font-size: large;"><b>Canada, Norway & Sweden</b></span> 
          is the world leaders that generates the highest renewable energy. Likewise, most countries in Africa does not much rely 
          on the renewable energy. This is because the highly cost of implementing renewable energy technologies in their countries.

        <h2>Global Electricity Consumption per Country</h2>
        <p>
          Let's find out how electricity consumption can affects the GDP per capita as well as the population by country.
          This scatterplot visualise the relationship between total electricity consumption and  GDP per capita.
          The higher the GDP per capita, the higher the total electricity consumption it takes. In this visualisation, 
          <span style="color: #e41a1c; font-size: large;"><b>United States</b></span> is the first-highest electricity consumption that consumes 1,013 Terawtt electricity which is double 
          to <span style="color: #984ea3; font-size: large;"><b>Russia</b></span>. However,many countries in 
            <span style="color: #ff7f00; font-size: large;"><b>Africa</b></span> are experiencing lacks of 
          electricity consumption with low GDP per capita.

          This parallel plot visualises the non-renewable electricity consumption by continent from 2000 to 2016.
          This non-rewewable electricity consumption included energy from biofuel, coal, gas, nuclear
          and oil. In these years, the coal still remains the main energy sources to produce electricity for 
          most countries.

          <h2>Country Ranking on Coal Electricity Consumption on Years </h2>
          <p>
            This bump chart visualizes the country ranking on coal electricity consumption on years.
            The ranking is only obtained from the top 10 country. In this chart, developed countries
            like 
            <span style="color: grey; font-size: large;"><b>United States</b></span>, 
            <span style="color: orange; font-size: large;"><b>China</b></span>,
            <span style="color: green; font-size: large;"><b>India</b></span> 
            remains the top 3 that consume a lot of electricity created by coal
            in 20th century. On the other hand, there is fluctuation on the ranking for countries 
            <span style="color: rgb(75, 132, 197); font-size: large;"><b>Australia</b></span> and 
            <span style="color: #32612D; font-size: large;"><b>Russia</b></span>
            over the years. However, there is a rise on the rank of 
            <span style="color: rgb(138, 221, 234); font-size: large;"><b>South Africa</b></span>.
            In 2016, 
            South Korea 
            has the sixth-largest
            coal electricity consumption in the world compare to 2001 which is only in rank 11. Canada was once
            the eleventh-highest coal electricity consumption. Until, the country has dropped out from the top 10 ranking country.

          <h2>Solar Electricity Consumption per Continent</h2>
          <p>This stack area visualise the trend of using solar electricity over the years. As the trend moves
            close to 2010, many country in different continent starts to implement solar energy. In this diagram, Asia is 
            is the first-highest solar energy consumption in 2016. This can mainly be contributed by China. It is then followed
             by Europe. It uses solar electricity as their main electricity production. It is also  times more than Americas.
             Likewise, continent like Africa and Oceania do not use high solar electricity consumption.
