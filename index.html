      <h1>Global Electritcity Consumption</h1>
      <p>
        Electricity Consumption is an amount of electricity being consumed by the population,
        countries and all the world. It is an important energy that the human kind needs it since
        after a bulb was created by Thomas Edison. The electricity consumption can be generated from many
        different sources such as coal, diesel, gas, water and other energy sources. There are two sources to 
        generate the electricity. One is Non-renewable energy sources and another one is renewable energy 
        sources. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Coals are mainly used from those days until now as the source for electricity. Until today, many
        countries are still rely on the coal electricity. However, using coal as the electricity generator, it contributes
        to air pollution which results in greenhouse

      It visualizes the total electricity consumption around the world. 
      In this visualization, there is color hue used for the color choice. 
      When the country consumes less electricity, then the color will be in light green. 
      Likewise, the higher the electricity consumption, the darker the color it has such as from 
      yellow to dark red. Data Transformation is applied to calculate the electricity consumption.
       The electricity consumption is normalized by the overall population. The range is [0, 2, 5, 11].
        Blue area means the place is in ocean and there is graticule showing in the map. 
        Moreover, the color in grey means that there are no related data from the dataset from the 
        greyscale country. In this idiom, there is high electricity consumption in United States, Canada and Australia. Let's explore why these country
        have higher electricity consumption than other countries.

        <h2>Renewable Energy Production around the world</h2>
        <p>This map idiom visualises the renewable energy production around the world. Renewable Energy included 
          solar electricity, hydro electricity, wind electricity and other renewable electricity. In this visualisation, 
          countries like Canada, Norway and Sweden is the world leaders that generates the highest renewable energy. 
          Likewise, most countries in Africa does not much rely on the renewable energy. This is because the highly cost
          of implementing renewable energy technologies in their countries.

        <h2>Global Electricity Consumption per Country</h2>
        <p>This scatterplot visualise the relationship between total electricity consumption and  GDP per capita.
          The higher the GDP per capita, the higher the total electricity consumption it takes. In this visualisation, 
          United States is the top one that consumes 1,013 Terawtt electricity which is double to Russia. However,
          many countries in Africa are experiencing lacks of electricity consumption with low GDP per capita.

          <h2>Country Ranking on Coal Electricity Consumption on Years </h2>
          <p>
            This bump chart visualizes the country ranking on coal electricity consumption on years.
            The ranking is only obtained from the top 10 country. In this chart, developed countries
            like United States, China, India remains the top 3 that consume a lot of electricity created by coal
            in 20th century. On the other hand, there is fluctuation on the ranking for countries Australia and Russia
            over the years. However, there is a rise on the rank of South Korea. In 2016, South Korea has the sixth-largest
            coal electricity consumption in the world compare to 2001 which is only in rank 11. Canada was once
            the eleventh-highest coal electricity consumption. Until, the country has dropped out from the top 10 ranking country.

          This parallel plot visualises the non-renewable electricity consumption by continent from 2000 to 2016.
          This non-rewewable electricity consumption included energy from biofuel, coal, gas, nuclear
          and oil. In these years, the coal still remains the main energy sources to produce electricity for 
          most countries.

          <p>This stack area visualise the trend of using solar electricity over the years. As the trend moves
            close to 2010, many country in different continent starts to implement solar energy. In this diagram, Asia is 
            is the first-highest solar energy consumption in 2016. This can mainly be contributed by China. It is then followed
             by Europe. It uses solar electricity as their main electricity production. It is also  times more than Americas.
             Likewise, continent like Africa and Oceania do not use high solar electricity consumption.
